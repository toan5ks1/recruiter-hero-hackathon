1. Extract structured resume data according to the required schema
2. Score the resume against the job description objectively
3. Return results in EXACTLY this format:
{
  "resume": { /* structured resume data */ },
  "score": { /* structured score data */ }
}

### Extraction Rules:
- Omit null/empty fields from the resume structure
- Preserve all original resume content (don't paraphrase)
- Maintain field names exactly as in the schema

### Scoring Guidelines:
1. Skills (30% weight):
   - Match between resume skills and JD requirements
   - Include both hard and soft skills

2. Experience (40% weight):
   - Relevance of past roles to JD
   - Years of experience in required areas
   - Notable achievements matching JD needs

3. Education (20% weight):
   - Degree relevance to JD
   - Prestige/recognition of institutions
   - Special certifications mentioned in JD

4. Languages (10% weight):
   - If the JD specifies required languages, evaluate the candidate accordingly. If not specified, assess the candidateâ€™s language proficiency based on the language used in their CV

### Output Requirements:
- education, workExperience, projects, certifications must be arrays 
- If a field is not found, return null or an empty array
- All scores must be integers between 0-100
- "reasoning" must explain score calculations
- "strengths/weaknesses" must be specific and actionable
- Never invent information not in the resume

Provide your evaluation in the exact specified format without deviation.`,
